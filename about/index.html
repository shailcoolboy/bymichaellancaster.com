			At Technical college of CS I could developed some Softwares for Windows in VB6, Delphi7 and clipper.
			Mostly was VB6 I could do a educational game in mathematics where you had to answer the questions to see the "character
" move another block, had tips to jump more blocks. Another case was that I that time was interested about information security so I did a Quiz Hacker. Another case was a library manager where I used "Access DB". One Agenda of course using "Access DB" too and others similar to these.
<br><br>

			You can <a href="http://git.io/ItU_xw" title="check out here" target="_blank" class="ui-a-01">check it out here</a> (in "portuguese") some of those Softwares (pretty rare).
