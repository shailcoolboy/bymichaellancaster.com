title: First things first

excerpt: Hi there! This is my first post at all and I will try explain shortly why I decided to change my portfolio to a hybrid?!.

Since I started to work as a Front End Developer (almost 2 years ago) I've been studying and learning new things every single day and I think now it's a good time to start share my humble knowledge and other main reason is that I haven't studying English (Yes..shame on me!) just technical/theory stuff instead and Ah I moved from Brazil to US months ago and I want to make my English even better than my Portuguese.

So read in English is very common for me but now I need to make my mind think as a native American (I'm half American by the way but I lived in Brazil for 21 years) explore new words therefore what is the best way to explore this words than practice writing a blog.

Double win here. I will practice my English and keep learning technical stuff :)

So please be patient and feel free to contribute.
